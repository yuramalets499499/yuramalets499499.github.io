# Weather

This Weather app:
* was created using HTML, CSS and SCSS, JS
* looks good in mobile browsers
* uses remote server for fetching data
* uses mocked data, so it will show "night" mode because of outdated sunrise/sunset data. If you want to use real data - update `url` constant in *weather.js* file with your url from https://openweathermap.org/forecast5

Here is [live demo](https://hiprofessional.github.io/weather/)
